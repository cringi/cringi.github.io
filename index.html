		<h3>What are memes?</h3>
		<p>A meme is "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person
			within a culture", according to Merriam-Webster. Memes are <em>so
			important</em> that there is a
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Wikipedia article</a>
			dedicated to it. However, that definition is garbage. Everyone knows that
			a quality meme has to look well done and professional, but to the
		  individual, a meme has a special meaning.</p>

		<h3>What about <em>dank</em> memes?</h3>
		<p>There is a fine line between a regular meme and a dank one.
			If all you do is make regular memes, you're probably twelve years old.
			However, if you make your memes dank, then you are a respected member
			of the meme community. Gaining this popularity is very important, as
			without it you're just another nerd with a grand total of three views
			on what you thought was a really good meme. You're wrong.</p>
