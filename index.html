    <h3>What are memes?</h3>
    <p>A meme is "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person
      within a culture", according to Merriam-Webster. Memes are <em>so
      important</em> that there is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Wikipedia article</a>
      dedicated to it. However, that definition is garbage. Everyone knows that
      a quality meme has to look well done and professional, but to the
      individual, a meme has a special meaning.</p>

    <h3>What about <em>dank</em> memes?</h3>
    <p>There is a fine line between a regular meme and a dank one.
      If all you do is make regular memes, you're probably twelve years old.
      However, if you make your memes dank, then you are a respected member
      of the meme community. Gaining this popularity is very important, as
      without it you're just another nerd with a grand total of three views
      on what you thought was a really good meme. You're wrong.</p>

    <h3>Published Studies by CHS Students</h3>

      study of memes and their dankness. Today, this information is freely
      available for the first time in meme history. Click on the names below

    <h3>I want my own page!</h3>
    <p>Great! Email us: <a href="mailto:dank@studyofme.me">dank@studyofme.me</a></p>
    <p>Seriously, I'll add in a page if you really want me to.</p>
    <h3>Who's responsible for this?</h3>
    <p>Figure it out another way.</p>
    <!-- Made by Brandon Berney! Congrats. -->
    <h3>In all seriousness</h3>
    <p>I spent most of class making this. Why? &#175;\_(&#12484;)_/&#175;
    There's no real purpose behind it, but I didn't have much to do and this was
    a good way to kill time.</p>
